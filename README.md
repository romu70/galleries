# Galleries

This is my hobby project to learn web development. The galleries website is made thanks to the fantastic [Astro](https://astro.build) framework.

This first gallery displays images of cool fonts found in read life. Interested to give some examples? Contact me here, I think through issues, it will be great.

And if you find a better way to do what I've done, and as learning is the very purpose of this repository, feel free to teach me. Thanks!
